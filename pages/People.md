### Luigi Perotti
---
<img style="float: right;" src="../../assets/img/people/luigi.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">
<div style="text-align: justify"> Dr. Perotti received his Laurea (B.S./M.S.) in Civil Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Italy and his M.S. and Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from the California Institute of Technology. His graduate studies focused on developing new finite element methods for thin shells and on solving high-rate fluid-solid interaction problems. As a postdoctoral scholar at UCLA, he applied the continuum and computational mechanics tools he learned during his Ph.D to understand the electrophysiology and mechanics of the healthy and failing heart and the conformational changes occurring during the maturation of viral capsids. As an Assistant professor at the University of Central Florida in the MAE department, Dr. Perotti continues the study of cardiac kinematics and function by combining computational mechanics and MR Imaging and of thin shell morphing structures inspired by the maturation of viral capsids.</div>

### Mehlil Ahmed
---
<img style="float: right;" src="../../assets/img/people/mehlil.jpg">

<div style="text-align: justify">Mehlil completed her B.Sc in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). During her undergraduate studies she was involved in designing Wind and Solar powered Oceangoing vessels for both her undergraduate thesis and 3rd year research project using computer aided design, Rhinoceros 3D, and Fluid Dynamics. The goals of her research are to compute the material properties and material laws describing the passive myocardium material response. A quantitative understanding of the passive myocardium material behavior will provide mechanistic and clinical insights into cardiac diseases, such as Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF), for which diagnostic biomarkers and causes are still elusive.</div>

<br />
<div style="text-align: justify">Uditha read for his B.Sc and M.Sc in Engineering at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. For his undergraduate thesis, he worked on homogenization of woven composites for deployable space structures using multiscale modeling techniques. For masters thesis, he investigated the non-linear bending behaviour of ultra thin woven composites at the meso-mechaniocal scale. Currently, he is reading for his Ph.D in Biomedical Engineering. The goal of his research is to investigate the ventricular motion in active contraction and reveal how cellular and meso-scale changes reflected in ventricular disfunction. </div>
